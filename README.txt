The index.html is the mainpage, but the game is found on an alternate page, theCSMCardGame.html

The Highscore board is found in the theCSMCardGame.html file

The README from Highscore API.zip doesn't mention "jquery-3.2.1.min.js", but its included anyway

The CardIdentity.html explains all the cards

I get an error in the HTML5 validator from the Highscore table

Good luck, have fun!

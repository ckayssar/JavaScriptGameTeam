			<h2>HOW THE GAME WORKS</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The Player and an AI will have 50 health points (HP)</li>
				<li>Before the Player and an AI can begin playing, the Player will choose between heads and tails and a coin will be flipped</li>
				<li>If the player wins the coin toss, they will be the first to “bet”. If they lose, they will be the second to “bet”</li>
				<li>The Player and an AI will have 6 cards in their hand to play</li>
				<li>The first to bet will wager an amount of health between 1 and 10 HP</li>
				<li>The Player will select a card (by clicking) and place a card in the middle</li>
				<li>The AI will place a card at the same time (at random)</li>
				<li>Every time a card is placed down, a replacement card will be drawn</li>
				<li>Whoever loses that round will lose the amount of HP that was wagered</li>
				<li>The person who gets to wager will alternate every turn</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>HOW THE CARDS WORK</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>There are 13 different types of card that can be drawn, this will be randomized</li>
				<li>It is possible to have 6 of the same card in your hand</li>
				<li>Each card has a different combination with another card</li>
				<li>Some combinations will result in a victory, others in a tie</li>
				<li>There are two different types of tie; good fits and unrelated</li>
				<li>Good fits result in the round continuing and a multiplier (x2) being applied to the bet</li>
				<li>An unrelated result causes both players to lose HP</li>
				<li>The back of the cards should have the same design</li>
				<li>The face of the cards should be different based on the cards themselves</li>
			</ul>

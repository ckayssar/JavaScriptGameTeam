			<h2>HOW THE GAME WORKS</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The Player and the Opponent (an AI) will have 50 health points, denoted as HP</li>
				<li>Before the Player and the AI can begin playing, the Player will choose between heads and tails and a coin will be flipped</li>
				<li>If the player wins the coin toss, they will be the first to “bet”. If they lose, the AI will be first to “bet”</li>
				<li>The Player and an AI will then gain 6 cards in their hand to play</li>
				<li>These 6 cards will not be revealed to the opponent</li>
				<li>The first to bet will wager an amount of health between 1 and 10 HP</li>
				<li>The Player will select a card (by clicking) and place a card in the middle</li>
				<li>The AI will place a card at the same time (a random one from their hand)</li>
				<li>Whoever loses that round will lose the amount of HP that was wagered</li>
				<li>When a round is completed, the card used will be replaced</li>
				<li>The Player and AI will trade betting responsibilites each turn</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>HOW THE CARDS WORK</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>There are 13 different types of card that can be drawn, this will be randomized</li>
				<li>It is possible to have multiple of the same card in your hand</li>
				<li>Each card forms a different result when faced with another card</li>
				<li>Some combinations will result in a victory, others in a tie</li>
				<li>There are two different types of tie; an "unrelated" tie and a "multiplier" tie</li>
				<li>A "multiplier" will add multiplier (x2) being applied to the bet</li>
				<li>After a "multiplier" result, the players must place another card down</li>
				<li>An "unrelated" result causes both players to lose HP, half that of the bet (this rounds down)</li>
				<li>This continues until someone runs out of HP</li>
				<li>If both players run out of HP, it is a tie</li>
			</ul>
			<article id="directions">
				<h3>Directions</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Type your name into the game</li>
					<li>Choose heads or tails. If you win the coin toss you get to bet first, if you lose the AI bets first</li>
					<li>You or the AI will make a bet between 1-10 HP</li>
					<li>You will then choose a card from your hand to place in the center. The AI will do the same</li>
					<li>If your card beats the AI's card they lose HP equal to the bet amount</li>
					<li>If their card beats your card you lose HP equal to the bet amount</li>
					<li>If the cards create a multiplier, the bet amount doubles and you go back to Step 4</li>
					<li>If the cards are unrelated, you AND the AI lose HP equal to half the bet amount. If HP/2 is a decimal, the amount of HP lost is rounded down</li>
					<li>Whoever did not bet this round bets for the next round in the same manner as Step 3</li>
					<li>The game ends when either you or the AI has less than 1 HP</li>
					<li>If both you and the AI go below 1 HP in the same round, nobody wins</li>
